# 2D Platformer Controller

This repository hosts the scripts for a 2D platformer controller designed for Unity without the use of Unity's built in rigid-bodies.

The controller supports:
 - Movement system (including walking on slopes, sliding, wall jumping and grapple hook)
 - Collision system (using custom raycasts,  supports both player and obstacle collisions)
 - Dynamic Platform system (supports up to N waypoints and velocity easing)
 - Custom camera system (with customizable offsets and custom tracking styles)
